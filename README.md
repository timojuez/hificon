## Preliminaries

- **A scheme** for communication is a plan that a server and client agree upon. It can be but not necessarily is a network protocol. Typically, different AVR manufacturers use their own scheme.
- **A target** is an entity that communicates using a scheme. A network amplifier can be a target.
- **A feature** is a variable that a target's scheme provides. It can be volume, power, etc.
- **A target URI** describes the connection to a target and has syntax `scheme:arg_0:...:arg_n`, where `scheme` is a class from ./src/schemes or of the form `[module.]scheme_class`. By default it is being read from the main.cfg. Example: `denon://192.168.1.5:23`
- A URI can carry a **query string** `?part_0&...&part_m` at the end which will be processed once initially according to the given order. If `part` has the form `feature=value`, the target's feature `feature` will be set to `value`. If `part` has the form `command` then `command` will be sent to the target. Example usage: `hifish -xt '?power=1&source=DVD&MVUP'`


### Supported Schemes

### Configuration
See configuration options in ~/.hificon/main.cfg and src/share/main.cfg.default.


## Usage

Note that we do not take any responsibility and you are using this software at your own risk.

### HiFiCon Tray Control
Start HiFiCon Tray Control:
`python3 -m hificon.tray`


### HiFiCon Menu Control

The menu lets you control all available features, e.g. sound mode, input, power, Audyssey settings, single speaker volume, etc. (depending on your target).

`python3 -m hificon.menu`



### HiFiSh HiFi Shell
HiFiSh is the HiFi Shell and it offers its own language called PyFiHiFi. PyFiHiFi is a Python dialect that is customised for programming with HiFiCon. It can read and write the target's features or run e.g. remote control actions (depending on the target).

#### Starting HiFiSh
Calling `hifish` without arguments will start the prompt.
To execute a command from bash, call `hifish -c '[command]'`.
Hifi scripts can be executed by `hifish FILE.hifi`

See also `hifish -h` and the ./examples/.

#### High level commands
High level features are not scheme (resp. amp manufacturer) dependent and in the form `$feature` for reading and `$feature=value` for writing.
Examples: `$volume += 5`, `$source = 'DVD'`, `$power = True`
To see what features are being supported, type `help_features()` in hifish or call `hifish --help-features`

#### Raw commands
Raw commands can be sent to the target like `COMMAND`. If your command contains a space or special character (`;`) or if you need it's return value, use the alternative way `$"COMMAND"`. Examples: `MV50`, `PWON`, `$'PW?'`

#### PyFiHiFi Language
HiFiSh compiles the code into Python as described below. The Python code assumes the following:
```
import time
from hificon import Target
__return__ = None
__wait__ = .1
target = Target()
```

| HiFiSh | Python |
| --- | --- |
| `CMD` or `$"CMD"` or `$'CMD'` | `target.query("CMD", __return__); time.sleep(__wait__)` |
| `$F` | `target.features.F.get()` |
| `$F = value` | `target.features.F.remote_set(value)` |
| `wait(X)` | `time.sleep(X)` |

If `__return__` is a callable, `$""` will return the received line from the target where `__return__(line) == True`.

#### Script Creator
`python3 -m hificon.create_script`

The create_script tool helps to create HiFi scripts automatically or even to record remote control actions.

Example 1: Record and repeat changing the feature values
```
python3 -m hificon.create_script record --raw > my_script.hifi # start recording
# now change the target's values that you want to store
hifish my_script.hifi # repeat
```

Example 2: Store all settings to file
```
python3 -m hificon.create_script -t emulate:denon full > example_script.hifi
```


### Server Software
You can implement an own scheme or protocol. Client and Server is being implemented into one single class. Inherit e.g. the class AbstractScheme or SocketScheme. Pay attention to the methods `poll_feature` and `set_feature`.
Start the server by running `python3 -m hificon.server --target SCHEME_MODULE.CLASS`

If the prefix `emulate:` is being added to `--target`, a dummy server will be run for testing. You can connect to it using the clients mentioned above.

Examples:
- `python3 -m hificon.server --target denon://0.0.0.0:23`
- `python3 -m hificon.server --target emulate:denon://127.0.0.1:1234`


## Development

### Support for other devices
It is possible to implement the support e.g. for other AVR brands like Yamaha, Pioneer, Onkyo. It is easy to connect to any network device that communicates with a socket. See src/schemes/* as an example. See also "target" parameter in config and in hifish. Hint: `hifish --target telnet://IP:PORT -f` prints all data received from `IP` via socket.

### Reverse Engineering a Target
`hifish -f` opens a shell and prints all received data. Meanwhile change settings on the target e.g. with a remote and observe on what it prints. This may help you to program an own scheme.

### Custom Client Software
It is possible to create an own program that controls the target and keeps being synchronised with it.
See ./examples/custom_client.py

Your requirement will be the hificon package.


### AVR Emulator
For testing purposes, there is a server emulator software. Start it with `python3 -m hificon.server --target emulate:SCHEME`.

The Denon AVR software emulator acts nearly like the amp's socket. Try it out: 
`python3 -m hificon.server --target emulate:denon://127.0.0.1:1234`
and connect to it e.g. via HiFiSh:
`hifish --target denon://127.0.0.1:1234`.

You can also emulate the HiFi Shell directly: `hifish --target emulate:denon`


## Troubleshoot
- If HiFiCon cannot find your device automatically, add its URI as "uri = SCHEME://IP:PORT" under [Target] to ~/.hificon/main.cfg in your user directory.
- If your device lets you connect only once but you would like to run several HiFiCon programs at the same time, run `python3 -m hificon.server --target repeat:auto --listen-port 1234`. In the clients, set `localhost:1234` as your target.
